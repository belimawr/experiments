set Java Home
=============

A small program to manipulate environment variables in Go.

It aims to provide an easy way to set JAVA_HOME and PATH to point to different java
installations. to do so it starts a new shell with the environment variables set.

I am not quite sure this is a good approach, however it is more a Go programming exercise
than a tool.
